# Pluribus - The Clock/Timer Symbolism

## What the Clock Shows

The show opens with a countdown clock, showing there are 439 days and however many hours, minutes, and seconds until something big happens.

## The Reversal

The countdown in Pluribus begins as soon as astronomers discover the RNA sequence, steadily ticking down as the infection spreads and nearly everyone succumbs to the virus.

**Once only Carol and a few others remain immune, the timer reverses direction and starts counting up.**

## Symbolic Meaning

The timer can be seen as a symbol of humanity's measure of progress. More often than not, we see happiness as a destination and count our way down to it. The countdown in the show seems to represent that.

Once people in Pluribus achieve "perfect happiness," they lose their connection to time itself, no longer seeing joy as something to chase. The clock's reversal signals the dawn of a new era — one where humanity's traditional sense of striving and forward momentum has vanished, replaced by a static, timeless existence that reflects the unsettling consequences of achieving absolute contentment.

## Narrative Purpose (GILLIGAN SOURCE)

According to writer-EP Gordon Smith in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter:

> "The countdown and the countup are a cool way to signify the before times and the after times."

> "Carol is not in sync with the Others. So keeping the clock in people's minds is about keeping tabs on where Carol is in relation to the event, and maybe it helps viewers figure out the time signature of the show."

## In the Finale

In the finale, a massive clock is now ticking about how long Carol has before they're going to turn her — the countdown returns, now counting down to Carol's forced conversion.

By the end of Episode 8 ("Charm Offensive"), 60 days have passed since Joining Day.

## The 8613 Signal (Fan Theory/Hypothesis)

Manousos landed on the number 8613, and now he's testing his theory that if these zombies come into contact with this frequency, they could revert back to their original form. This suggests that the original human souls are still within their body.

**Fan Discovery:** Some fans on Reddit explained that this was hiding in plain sight all along—the *Pluribus* intro with the visual wave with every dot snapping into a perfect, rhythmic grid is the 8613.0 signal. "The intro is showing us that the Hive needs that external broadcast to stay synced."
