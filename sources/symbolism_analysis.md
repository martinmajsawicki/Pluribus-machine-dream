# Pluribus - Symbolism, Themes & Analysis

## Title Symbolism

The title of the series refers to *e pluribus unum*, a Latin motto of the United States which means "out of many, one." This reflects the show's central concept of humanity becoming unified into a single collective consciousness.

## Core Thematic Meaning

In imagining Earth's population mentally fused to form a billions-strong network of collective intelligence that verges on omniscience, this eerie new Apple TV series has surfaced profound insights on what it means to be a person.

*Pluribus* is an experiment in wish fulfillment, one that acknowledges how much our fascination with postapocalyptic stories reflects a covert desire to be rid of the aggravation of our fellow human beings.

When Carol offends the Others by drugging and interrogating Zosia, her designated handler, they finally leave her all alone in the city. She can take whatever she wants, go wherever she wants, do whatever she wants.

## Emotional Future, Not Technological Future

Where other sci-fi shows show us a vision of the future through flying cars and laser guns and jet packs and cities on other planets, *Pluribus*'s fantastical concept is mere window dressing for what it's really showing us: our emotional future.

A world so devoid of understanding and connection that we would consider giving up what makes us human just to feel something.

## The Central Allegory: Love as Both Virtue and Flaw

The Season 1 finale took the form of a wrenching allegory about how love—that supposedly generous and purifying emotion—can make us selfish to the point of self-destruction.

Love that is discerning and specific and that fills emotional voids within individuals is part of what makes us human. Our capacity to love is, in fact, one of our most endearing traits as a species. It's also a tragic flaw.

With oxytocin spewing from our hypothalami, we're liable to put our own happiness and that of the people we love over the good of humanity as a whole.

## Multi-Layered Interpretation

Cast member Carlos-Manuel Vesga noted: "The genius of what Vince and his team have created is that it's something that ignites your mind, conversation and debate without telling you what it's about. You can ask ten people what Pluribus is about, you'll hear ten different answers."

He personally kept thinking of *Brave New World* by Aldous Huxley—controlling people differently from *1984*'s repression and terror.

## Hidden Symbolism: The 8613 Signal

Manousos landed on the number 8613, and now he's testing his theory that if these zombies come into contact with this frequency, they could revert back to their original form. This suggests that the original human souls are still within their body, and if Manousos puts them near this frequency, it will interrupt whatever other frequencies have taken them over.

**Fan Discovery:** Some fans on Reddit explained that this was hiding in plain sight all along—the *Pluribus* intro with the visual wave with every dot snapping into a perfect, rhythmic grid is the 8613.0 signal. "The intro is showing us that the Hive needs that external broadcast to stay synced," said one viewer.

## Season 1 Finale Summary: "La Chica o El Mundo"

"La Chica o El Mundo" ("The Girl or the World")

The finale opens with Kusimayu (Darinka Arones) surrounded by loved ones in their small Peruvian village. She is one of 13 survivors of the global shift known as The Joining. A special gas has been delivered via plane, and she happily inhales it, briefly convulsing in a state of hive-mind bliss. She's one of the Others now.

Carol chooses the titular girl over the world, and she and Zosia embark on globe-trotting adventures, including a luxurious ski trip.

The honeymoon phase comes to a screeching halt when Zosia lets it slip that the Others have found a way to potentially convert Carol into one of them, against her will.

*Pluribus* ends its first season with the arrival of an atom bomb, foreshadowed earlier in "Grenade" when the Others tell Carol they'd give her one if she asked.
