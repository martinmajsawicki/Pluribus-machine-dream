# Vince Gilligan's Storytelling Techniques & Philosophy

These techniques from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul inform how to analyze Pluribus.

## CORE NARRATIVE PHILOSOPHY

### The "Mr. Chips to Scarface" Arc
Gilligan's signature: take a recognizable character and transform them through choices. Walter White went from teacher to drug lord. The key is showing **every step** so transformation feels earned and inevitable.

### Characters Tell You Where to Go
"What works best is not to be too rigid in your thinking... TV at its best is a living, breathing thing. It's organic. And if you're organic in your storytelling which means letting your characters tell you where they need to go, instead of trying to force them into directions that they don't want to take."

### Avoid Forcing Theme
"I learned a long time ago it's a mistake to try to think too thematically, or to try to push a theme or a moral or a point onto the audience. The best version of this is if the audience tells me what the show means."

## THE SLOW BURN

### Pacing Philosophy
"I just love showmanship. To me, that is the essence of showmanship: showing the audience something they don't quite understand at first, and then it slowly dawns on them what it is they're watching."

"It's a plus in a world of very fast-paced editing and TikTok videos that are only a minute long. If the whole world were to move at that pace, that TikTok pace of storytelling, that would be very sad to me."

### Give the Bare Minimum
Gilligan's philosophy: "give the audience the bare minimum" — sometimes telling the story too fast "becomes problematic in and of itself and you risk losing viewers by the very fact that you are working too hard and the sweat is showing."

## CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

### Constant State of Change
"One of the things that intrigued me as a possibility of doing Breaking Bad was the idea of doing something TV doesn't usually do, which is to show a character in a constant state of change. TV is very good at stasis."

### Self-Delusion as Driver
Gilligan believes no one sees themselves as the "bad guy." Walter White is a master of self-delusion, convincing himself he's a good provider even as he descends deeper into criminality.

### No Marginal People
Producer Mark Johnson: "You never sense that Vince is talking down to a character, no matter how fallen, compromised or ungifted he or she may be. There are no marginal people in a Vince Gilligan screenplay."

## THE MANDATE TO SURPRISE

"It's always a conscious choice to surprise people. That is always the mandate."

Gilligan is "not only willing but eager to eliminate great characters, take risks, and veer off the most obvious path."

"Having a rock solid idea of how it all should end is counterproductive. If you're too rigid in your thinking you may miss some wonderful opportunities for storytelling."

## VISUAL LANGUAGE & COLOR THEORY

### Color as Character State
"Color is important on 'Breaking Bad'; we always try to think in terms of it. We always try to think of the color that a character is dressed in, in the sense that it represents on some level their state of mind."

### Breaking Bad Colors:
- **Blue**: Purity (Skyler's early wardrobe, the meth itself)
- **Yellow**: Caution, moral decay, meth trade (Jesse's signature)
- **Green**: Growth OR greed (context-dependent)
- **Purple**: Self-deception, protection, royalty (Marie)
- **Beige → Black**: Walt's transformation arc shown through wardrobe

### Better Call Saul: Fire and Ice Theory
- **Red/Orange**: Crime, lawlessness (Nacho, criminal world)
- **Blue**: Law, morality (Jimmy's "good" side)
- **Black & White**: Flash-forwards to Gene timeline

## ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES

The throughline of all Gilligan work: **actions have consequences**.

"At their heart, both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul say: 'actions have consequences' — a simple message that Gilligan points out eluded episodic TV for years."

---

## MORAL SENSIBILITY (EVOLUTION)

Gilligan is known for "the keen moral sensibility that has always permeated" his work.

**Recent shift:** Though proud of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, "the once avowedly apolitical storyteller has become convinced that pop culture's recent supersaturation with antiheroes has been unhealthy for society."

This may explain Pluribus's shift toward exploring **benevolent** control rather than villainous transformation.
