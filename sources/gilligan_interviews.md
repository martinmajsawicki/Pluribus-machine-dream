# Vince Gilligan Interviews - Pluribus

## On Meaning and Themes

Gilligan stated: "I really want people to take away whatever they choose to take away from this show. I learned a long time ago it's a mistake to try to think too thematically, or to try to push a theme or a moral or a point onto the audience. The best version of this is if the audience tells me what the show means."

He reflected on his Breaking Bad era: "I listen to some of [the Breaking Bad Insider Podcast interviews] again, every now and then, and I'm just thinking, 'Would you just shut up? It's not yours anymore.' When you make a TV show or a movie, or you write a novel...at a certain point, it's not yours anymore. It belongs to the people who enjoy it."

## On AI and Conformity Interpretations

Though its surface trappings lean firmly into alien science fiction, Pluribus is also operating within a deeper thematic current, one that's using its high sci-fi premise to examine the societal dangers of artificial intelligence and the increasing automation and isolation of modern human interaction.

The series examines groupthink, benevolent control, and AI-driven conformity, breaking down how validation, consent, and individuality collide. The parallels with generative AI are notable, and the series reads as an indictment of how artificial intelligence can gradually dull independent thought.

**Note:** Contrary to many readings of Pluribus since its premiere, the gestation of the idea predated recent developments in generative artificial intelligence and the pandemic. Gilligan says the goal was to "hit every trope and touchstone that the sci-fi movie world presents to us," citing *The Twilight Zone* and 1956's *Invasion of the Body Snatchers* as reference points.

## On the Original vs. Final Ending

"We had an ending that was perfectly good. It would have been satisfying but not as satisfying. And we got a note... Apple and Sony said, 'Is there an even better ending to be had?' And we listened, and I'm really glad they gave us that note. It made for a better ending."

The original ending was more subtle: "Carol secretly forges a pact with Manousos, slips him a note and is perhaps going to play double agent. There wasn't as much of a flag planted."

"Other than the atom bomb not being part of it, it was not open warfare."
