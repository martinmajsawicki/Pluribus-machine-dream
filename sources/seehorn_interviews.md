# Rhea Seehorn Interviews - Pluribus

## On Working with Vince Gilligan

When Vince first came to Seehorn and said he wrote something for her, she didn't know anything about it, but she just said yes, because of him.

Seehorn says Carol's character was originally imagined as a male protagonist, but was rewritten for her to take the starring role.

## On Carol's Character - Team Carol

Seehorn stated: "I would absolutely be Team Carol as far as arguing the necessity and the positives of individual thinking."

She explained: "There's never going to be a joke that you haven't heard. There's never going to be a surprise behavior that makes you laugh."

## On Carol's Vulnerability and Skepticism

Seehorn noted that Carol is "wrestling with this idea of feeling so exposed and ashamed that she tried to allow herself to believe that she was special."

Even while falling in love, "there are still these glimmers of... a consciousness in there. There is a skeptic in there that hasn't gone away."
