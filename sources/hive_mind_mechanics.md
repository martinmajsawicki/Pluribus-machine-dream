# Pluribus - Hive Mind Mechanics: Shared vs. Private

## What Is Shared

The Others are all joined via a "psychic glue" that maintains a constant connection between everyone in the Joining. In other words:
- They all know what the others are thinking
- They're always thinking the same thing
- They can access each other's memories
- One shared consciousness across the entire planet

## The Nature of "We"

Humanity has merged into one consciousness, a global entity that calls itself "We."

The new hive mind brings billions of bodies into perfect harmony, eliminating:
- War
- Poverty
- Loneliness

## Do They Retain Individuality?

Though the members of this hive mind **claim** that they retain their individuality, they also have full access to each others' thoughts, emotions and memories.

In this state, where everything is shared, they exist in an ongoing sense of bliss, one that either leads to or arises from:
- Complete absence of violence
- A shared purpose

**Key Question:** The central philosophical thrust of Pluribus is its critique of homogenized thought. While the Others appear benevolent — peaceful, kind, and content — the show is clear that these traits are achieved at the expense of individual choice.

Happiness, emotion, and human complexity are not organically derived; they are **imposed**.

## The Fear of Incompleteness

The hive mind's unity is incomplete. Only thirteen people are immune to the Joining, and among them, Carol becomes both a symbol of hope and a potential extinction level bug in the system.

The hive mind's desperation to bring her in grows out of a fear that should be impossible for a collective intelligence: **the fear of incompleteness**.

## Philosophical Questions Raised

### On Consciousness Without Separation
The question of whether a fetus has separate consciousness within the hive exposes a deeper tension: **can a being truly be alive if it has never been separate?**

In Pluribus, life without separation is existence without identity. The more the hive insists that everyone is one, the more the show pushes us to ask whether that oneness is life, or a very elegant coma.

### The Central Moral Question
> "Can consciousness without individuality ever be moral, or is empathy without choice just another form of tyranny?"

## Constraints on the Others

The Others cannot:
- Lie
- Harm any living creature (not even plants)
- Pick an apple or harvest grain
- Take Carol's stem cells without her consent

They can only eat what falls or dies naturally. They also consume protein derived from naturally deceased human bodies.

**They will starve within ten years.**
