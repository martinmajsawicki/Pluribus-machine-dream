## Status Changes

### Who Joined the Hivemind
**Kusimayu** - In the season finale ("La Chica o El Mundo"), she is shown in Peru surrounded by loved ones. A special gas is delivered via plane, and she happily inhales it, briefly convulsing in a state of hive-mind bliss. She becomes one of the Others willingly.

This brings the total immune number down from 13 to 12.

### Who Died During the Joining (Not Immune)
**Helen** - Carol's manager and romantic partner. She died during the Joining event itself, seemingly from a head injury after her body was seized and incapacitated by the virus. Helen was NOT immune — she died in the chaos.

Over 800 million people died from the Joining, either because being put into a state of shock caused hazardous situations like car crashes or falling onto concrete.
