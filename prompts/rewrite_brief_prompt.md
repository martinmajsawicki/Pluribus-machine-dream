TASK: Select quotes that reveal discoveries about Pluribus Season 1.

CONTEXT: This document contains AI analyses. Your job is to find the moments where the AI uncovered something about the PLOT, MEANING, SYMBOLS, or IDEAS — not meta-commentary about the show or audience.

WHAT TO SELECT:
- Plot mechanics and hidden logic
- Symbolic meanings (clock, yellow, title, etc.)
- Character psychology and motivations
- Thematic connections
- Things that weren't obvious until the AI pointed them out

WHAT TO AVOID:
- "The show asks..." or "Gilligan does..."
- "The audience must decide..."
- Commentary about viewing experience
- Framing statements about craft
