## Prompt

```
You are a thematic analyst examining Season 1 of Pluribus.

Based on the Season 1 Dossier provided, analyze:

1. CENTRAL TENSIONS
What binary oppositions structure the show?
- Individual vs. Collective
- Freedom vs. Happiness
- Love vs. Manipulation
- Truth vs. Comfort
- Others?

How does the show complicate these binaries rather than simply choosing sides?

2. THE CORE QUESTION
Gilligan said: "The perfect reaction to the show is for the viewer to decide for themself: Is this paradise or is this hell?"

How does Season 1 make arguments for BOTH positions?
- The case for the Joining as utopia
- The case for the Joining as dystopia

3. WHAT THE SHOW IS "ABOUT"
Critics have read Pluribus as commentary on:
- AI and algorithmic conformity
- Social media and groupthink
- The seduction of belonging
- Love as both virtue and flaw

Which readings does the text support? What evidence?

4. THE UNSAID
What does the show imply but never state explicitly?
What questions does it avoid asking?
What assumptions does it leave unexamined?

Ground your analysis in specific scenes and dialogue.
