1. CAROL STURKA
- What is her psychological profile? Her wounds, defenses, desires?
- Where is she in her transformation arc by the finale?
- What self-delusions does she hold?
- The name "Sturka" comes from a Twilight Zone character revealed to be an alien. What might this foreshadow?

2. THE IMMUNE SPECTRUM
The 13 immune represent different responses to the Joining:
- Manousos (absolute resistance)
- Carol (conflicted resistance)
- Laxmi (denial)
- Koumba (collaboration)
- Kusimayu (willing surrender)

What does each position represent? What argument does each make?

3. ZOSIA AND THE OTHERS
- Is Zosia an individual or a performance by the collective?
- What do the Others actually want? What are their constraints?
- The Others cannot lie — how does this shape the drama?

4. CHARACTER FUNCTIONS

- What role does Helen (the dead partner) play despite being gone?
- What does Manousos's journey from Paraguay represent?

Be specific about how characters function in the narrative, not just who they are.
