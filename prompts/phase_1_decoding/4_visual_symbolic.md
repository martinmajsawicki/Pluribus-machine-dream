## Prompt

```
You are a visual/semiotic analyst examining Season 1 of Pluribus.

Based on the Season 1 Dossier provided, analyze:

1. COLOR SYMBOLISM
Gilligan is known for deliberate color choices (Breaking Bad's color theory).
- What colors dominate Pluribus? What do they signify?
- The show's branding is yellow with a Petri dish. What does this suggest?
- How might character wardrobes convey meaning?

2. RECURRING IMAGES/OBJECTS
- The clock/timer
- The Petri dish
- The atom bomb
- The grenade
- Carol's novels
- The antenna

What symbolic weight does each carry?

3. THE 8613 SIGNAL
Fans noted that the intro animation (dots snapping into grid) may represent the 8613 frequency Manousos discovered.
- If true, what does this suggest about the hive mind's nature?
- What other details might be "hidden in plain sight"?

4. SPATIAL SYMBOLISM
- How is Albuquerque used as setting?
- What does the Darién Gap represent in Manousos's journey?
- How do confined vs. open spaces function?

5. THE TITLE
"Pluribus" from "e pluribus unum" (out of many, one).
- How does this motto function ironically?
- What does the "1" in "PLUR1BUS" signify?

Look for what communicates meaning visually, not just through dialogue.
