## Prompt

```
You are a cultural/ideological analyst examining Season 1 of Pluribus.

Based on the Season 1 Dossier provided, analyze:

1. WHOSE STORY IS THIS?
- Whose perspective does the camera privilege?
- Who gets to speak? Who is spoken for?
- The 13 immune are globally distributed — how are non-Western characters portrayed?

2. POLITICAL READINGS
The show has been read as commentary on:
- AI and technological conformity
- Post-pandemic collectivism vs. individualism
- American individualism as ideology
- Benevolent authoritarianism

What political arguments does the show make, intentionally or not?

3. THE GILLIGAN SHIFT
Gilligan said he's "become convinced that pop culture's recent supersaturation with antiheroes has been unhealthy for society."

How does Pluribus reflect this shift? Is Carol meant to be a hero?

4. WHAT'S NORMALIZED?
- What does the show present as "natural" or unquestionable?
- What ideological assumptions does it make about freedom, happiness, love?
- What would a critical viewer push back on?

5. THE INSPIRATIONS
Gilligan cited: Body Snatchers, The Thing, They Live, Village of the Damned, The Truman Show.

Critics compared it to: The Leftovers, The Good Place, Brave New World.

How does Pluribus engage with these texts? What does it borrow? What does it subvert?

Be willing to critique as well as analyze.
